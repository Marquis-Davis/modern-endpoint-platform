# Modern Endpoint Platform

## Overview

This repository represents my approach to designing scalable, security-integrated endpoint platforms across hybrid and cloud-native environments.

The focus is on:

- Lifecycle-driven device architecture
- Automation-first endpoint governance
- ConfigMgr and Intune co-management strategy
- Conditional Access device logic alignment
- Defender for Endpoint posture integration
- Microsoft Graph automation patterns

This project models platform-level thinking rather than isolated scripting.

## Architecture Principles

Modern endpoint environments should be:

1. **Lifecycle-aware**  
   Provisioning → Configuration → Compliance → Risk Evaluation → Access Decision → Monitoring → Retirement

2. **Security-integrated**  
   Device compliance and risk must influence Conditional Access decisions.

3. **Automation-first**  
   Reduce operational debt through modular and repeatable automation.

4. **Governed**  
   Configuration baselines and policy drift should be measurable and auditable.

5. **Scalable**  
   Designed to operate across enterprise-scale device estates.

## Planned Modules

- Intune policy export & configuration drift detection
- Conditional Access audit toolkit
- Defender device risk reporting
- Autopilot governance utilities
- Shared logging and HTML reporting framework

## Purpose

To build and document enterprise-grade endpoint platform patterns using automation, governance, and security alignment.
