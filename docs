# Endpoint Lifecycle Model

Modern endpoint platforms should be designed around lifecycle stages rather than tools.
This model separates tooling from architecture and focuses on governance, identity trust, and security alignment across the device lifecycle.

## 1. Procurement
- Hardware standardization
- Vendor abstraction strategy
- Asset tagging and identity planning

## 2. Enrollment
- Autopilot registration
- Azure AD join / Hybrid join decision
- Enrollment Status Page optimization

## 3. Configuration
- Baseline policy layering
- Settings catalog governance
- Application deployment strategy

## 4. Compliance
- Device health attestation
- Compliance policy evaluation
- Risk signal integration

## 5. Risk Evaluation
- Defender for Endpoint risk level
- Vulnerability exposure tracking
- Security posture alignment

## 6. Access Decision
- Conditional Access device filters
- Compliance-based access control
- Risk-based session enforcement

## 7. Monitoring & Drift Detection
- Policy version control
- Configuration drift monitoring
- Reporting automation

## 8. Retirement
- Device wipe / reset
- Autopilot cleanup
- Identity removal
- Asset lifecycle closure

  ## Lifecycle Flow

Procurement → Enrollment → Configuration → Compliance → Risk Evaluation → Access Decision → Monitoring → Retirement
